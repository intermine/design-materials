                        <p>Having originally studied Maths at Cambridge, he became fascinated with
                            genetics through attending courses taught by Sir Ronald Fisher. He has
                            since been involved in everything from the Human Genome Project to cancer
                            research and human population genetics. Recently he led a project at
                            Oxford focusing on the genetic make-up of the UK population, featured in
                            the Channel 4 television series "Faces of Britain".</p>

                        <p>Famous for his research on embryonic stem cells and mouse genetic
                            manipulation tools, Professor Bradley is the former Director of the
                            Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and is in charge of the Mouse Genomics
                            Team there.</p>

                            specialises in basic research into cell cycle regulation, using mainly the

                        <p>Professor Harberd's research focuses on the question of how the environment
                            influences plant biology. He works on a range of plant species, using whole
                            genome sequencing to gain insight into both basic and applied aspects of
                            plant genetics.</p>

                        <p>Dr Heard's research focuses on X chromosome inactivation during development
                            using mouse as a model. Her research has shown that this is an extremely
                            dynamic process, with the inactivation of the maternal and paternal X
                            chromosome alternating in a carefully orchestrated pattern. She is currently
                            the Director of the Genetics and Developmental Biology unit at the Institut
                            Curie in Paris, and has received the CNRS Silver Medal for her research.</p>

                        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/bms/research/ingham">www.shef.ac.uk</a>
                        <p>Professor Ingham's research uses zebrafish as a model for understanding vertebrate embryonic
                            development. In particular, he works on signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks, and
                            studies their importance both in the context of healthy development and as a model for human
                            disease. His approach is based on understanding complex biological processes in the context of
                            the whole organism. He established the MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics at
                            the University of Sheffield, of which he is currently Director. As well as being a Fellow of
                            the Royal Society, he is also a member of EMBO, a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences,
                            and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He received the Medal of the
                            Genetics Society of Great Britain in 2005.</p>

                        <p>Professor Leyser's research is aimed at understanding the role of plant hormones in plant developmental
                            plasticity, using the regulation of shoot branching as a model. Specifically, it focuses on the roles
                            of auxin and other hormones in activating leaf axils to produce branches. Professor Leyser is the
                            Associate Director of the Sainsbury Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. She has received a
                            number of awards including the Society of Experimental Biology’s President’s Medal (2000), the Royal
                            Society Rosalind Franklin Award (2007) and the International Plant Growth Substance Association’s Sliver
                            Medal (2010), and she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2009. She is a Fellow
                            of the Royal Society, a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences, and a Member of EMBO.</p>

                        <p>Recognised as a world authority on cell signalling and the molecular
                            mechanisms that lead to cancer, Professor Marshall's work identified a number
                            of important oncogenes and signaling pathways, the knowledge of which is now
                            being used to develop new cancer treatments. He is the Director of Research
                            at the CRUK Institute of Cancer Research, and has received a number of
                            prestigious prizes, recently including the Lifetime Achievement in Cancer

                        <p>Professor Martienssen's research centres around various aspects of the
                            epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation - particularly focusing on RNAi and
                            heterochromatin in plants and fission yeast. His research ranges from
                            studying their impact on the evolution of genome organisation and their role
                            in the regulation of cell fate, to using genomics and RNAi to develop
                            potential sources of biofuel. He is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute
                            Investigator, and currently holds the International Blaise Pascal Chair in
                            Paris.</p>

                        <p>Focusing on cell polarity and its importance in the context of development, Professor St Johnston uses
                            Drosophila embryos as a model for studying this important basic biological process. While this is basic
                            research, it is known that tumour cells lose polarity, and the relevant genes identified have also been
                            linked to a number of cancers. He is the director of the Gurdon Institute in Cambridge.</p>
