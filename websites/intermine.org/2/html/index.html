                <p class="important">Using InterMine, you can create databases of biological data accessed
                    by sophisticated web query tools. Parsers are provided for integrating data from many
                    common biological data sources and formats, and there is a framework for adding your
                    own data. InterMine includes an attractive, user-friendly web interface that works
                    'out of the box' and can be easily customised for your specific needs, as well as a
                    powerful, scriptable web-service API to allow programmatic access to your data.</p>

            <p>InterMine instances offer a range of services through a RESTful HTTP interface. These
                services expose data and operations that are accessible from any script or programme that
                can communicate over HTTP. To facilitate this, we also publish client libraries in a number
                of popular languages to simplify the construction of webservice requests, and the parsing
                of webservice responses.</p>

                <p>This release of InterMine contains a major shift in the UserProfile porting process
                    (moving the userprofile data from one production database to another). Previously
                    InterMine developers had to write and read the userprofile XML manually, during which
                    the code "upgraded" lists to reflect the data in the new production database. This was
                    transparent.</p>

                <p>The system that precompiles widgets is based on the <a href="#">Node.js</a> platform which

                    Head over to the homepage or visit this Joyent guide to install the platform. Remember
                    that installing by building will execute built in tests that can take a couple of minutes
                    to run on slower machines.</p>
