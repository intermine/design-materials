There are some differences between the 'outlines' and the
non-outlines pdf. The outlines one has the fixed @ sign and
has the species names in italics. I had to do these manually
with the outlined glyphs.

The font used is called DIN. It is available on the Powerbook.

RCS (the printing company) keep a copy of all the artwork. They
will have the original illustrator files if you need them.
Also, they can reprint with the artwork they have - just ask
them, they're very helpful!
