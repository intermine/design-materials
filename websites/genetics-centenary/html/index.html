                    <p>Exactly one hundred years ago, the first Chair in Genetics in the world - the
                    Balfour Professorship - was established here in Cambridge. In the century
                    that ensued, the professorship was, among others, held by Reginald Punnett,
                    who co-discovered genetic linkage, and Ronald A. Fisher - hailed as "the
                    father of modern statistics and experimental design". The Balfour Professors
                    both contributed to the cutting edge of genetics research themselves, and
                    inspired many to pursue the same path.</p>

                    <p>To celebrate this important anniversary, a one day symposium organised by
                    the Department of Genetics is taking place on the 7th September 2012, with
                    related informal events happening throughout the weekend. The speakers
                    include former students and staff members who have since gone on to
                    trail-blaze in their respective areas of genetics, often crediting their passion
                    for genetics to the inspiration gained during time spent in the Genetics
                    Department.</p>

                    <p>Unique in both the breadth and the impact of the science presented, this
                    symposium takes us on a whirlwind tour of cutting edge biology research,
                    including population genetics, ES cells, cell cycle regulation, epigenetics,
                    cell signaling, cell polarity and cancer research.</p>
