# InterMine 2012 (Smith et al.) Paper Diagrams

## Specs

* Web screen dumps: The editors prefer tables or figures instead of web screen dumps. All figures should have a white background to increase the contrast between the illustration and the background, so that the figure is easy to read.
* Line illustrations: These must be of sufficient quality for publication as submitted, i.e. clear, sharp, clean and of even density. Figures will NOT be redrawn or relabelled. Any lettering or text should be in proportion with the rest of the figure.
* Photographs: These must be of sufficient quality with respect to detail, contrast, and fineness of grain to withstand the unavoidable loss of contrast inherent in the printing process.
* Colour figures: Inclusion of colour figures is subject to a special charge (£350/US$600/€525 to print a figure in colour). Orders from the UK will be subject to the current UK VAT charge. For orders from elsewhere in the EU you or your institution should account for VAT by way of a reverse charge.  Please provide us with your or your institution’s VAT number. 
* Online-only colour figures: Colour figures can be uploaded as Supplementary Data at no extra charge. Please contact the bioinformatics@oup.com for details.
