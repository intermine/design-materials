<para>Have a column that would mark genes which had big expression
changes observed under some conditions.  i.e.  A list of experiments
sorted by significance of expression change.</para>

<para>A similar link-in would sort the list of mutations that affect the
expression of a given gene.  This would be a subset of the above list
but one that many people would find useful.</para>
